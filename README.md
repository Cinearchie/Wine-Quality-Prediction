# Wine-Quality-Prediction
This project involves predicting the quality of wine using machine learning. The Random Forest algorithm is used to build a predictive model, and various Python libraries are employed for data manipulation, visualization, and model evaluation.

Libraries Used - 
NumPy: For numerical operations and array manipulations.
Pandas: For data loading, manipulation, and analysis.
Matplotlib: For data visualization and plotting.
scikit-learn: For implementing the Random Forest algorithm and splitting the dataset.
